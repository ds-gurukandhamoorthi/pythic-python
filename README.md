This code borrows its core from <http://github.com/Twinside/vim-haskellConceal> and from <http://github.com/ehamberg/vim-cute-python>


The main difference between the other projects and this one is the lack of one-to-one binding.

The end result is a math-like code...

The conceal symbols would remind people of haskell or APL
